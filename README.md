# Full-Stack Banking Application

## Capstone Option 1

### Description:

This Full-Stack Banking Application was developed for my Capstone Project at MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN.

The objective of this project was to build a full-stack web application using the MERN Stack, create a back-end API with Express, create and interact with a database, and integrate React with a back-end Express API. 

### Installation Guidelines

1. Clone the Git repository: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project files. Then, use the git clone command followed by the URL of the Git repository to clone the repository to your local machine. For example, if the repository URL is https://github.com/username/project.git, you can run the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/username/project.git
```

2. Install project dependencies: Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and use the npm install command to install all the required dependencies for the project. For example:

```shell
cd project
npm install
```

3. Run the project: Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run the project by using the appropriate command specified in the project's documentation or package.json file. For example, if the project uses Node.js and has a start script defined in the package.json file, you can run the following command to start the project:

``` shell 
npm start
```

In your terminal run the following:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:anthgrim/badbank-standalone.git
cd badbank-standalone
npm install
node index.js
```
